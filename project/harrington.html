            The Harrington was founded to be a permanent extension of Summit Cuse to host their shows. When Josh started Summit Cuse, he wanted experience working in the music industry and booking bands to play various shows. The only problem, he didn’t have a place for these bands to play. For Summit Cuse’s first semester as an organization, they would act as the agent to connect artists with locations. They relied on the houses other their peers to host these shows. Then, when Josh became a Junior and moved into the Euclid neighborhood, he could rely on his basement to host shows. By gutting the basement, Josh was able to install speakers, microphones, lights, and a sound mixing board to host house shows.

            The Harrington held its first show in October 2021. They have specialized in rap and rock artists from the Syracuse community. They have hosted a slew of sold-out shows throughout the past year. The Harrington is one of the only venues to offer a presale option for their shows and has sold out shows within a few hours of announcing the show. They are quickly rising in popularity as they have just hit 1,000 followers on Instagram. The problem they now face is the lack of an ability to expand. There is no way to increase the capacity of the basement of a house rented by college students.

            Outside of music, the Harrington has recently partnered with The Pits Vintage, a student-run vintage clothing business. The Pits Vintage sells clothes on the first floor of the house, while the concert is going on in the basement.
