                    The Garden was started by Jennifer Jordan, Lauren Brennan, and Kenneth Barrist. Lauren and Ken are graduating in the spring of 2023, while Jen is graduating with an accelerated MBA in the spring of 2024. Lauren and Jen were living in the Euclid neighborhood their junior year when they decided to transform their basement into a music venue. They built a stage a stage and marked off a standing area and were ready for the entertainment to come in. They transformed their basement in the summer of 2021, purchasing multiple rolls of artificial turf to create a focal wall. Artists set up in front of this wall to play to the crowd of just under 100 people that fit into the basement. With Jen and Lauren both majoring in Music Industry, they have many connections to the student artists that attend Syracuse University. This made booking artists consist of sending a quick text to their friends and classmates.

                    Their very first show had a lineup of Bri Gillard and Tessa Pulgar, two Syracuse juniors at the time. People could attend by paying a small $5 entrance fee and then were able to enjoy the acoustic music inside. The Garden specializes in indie, pop, and acoustic music. They are a quieter venue with a more chill vibe in the audience.

                    Part of the reason the garden went for quieter genres of music was because of their surrounding neighbors. At their first location, the garden was nestled in the middle of many residential houses, not college rentals. This meant there were families living in these houses that would not enjoy loud rock music coming from the gardenâ€™s basement late into the night on weekends.

                    Outside of music, the Garden has hosted a comedy night and open mic night. These two events did not have a headliner, instead, it was a way for the students who usually stand in the audience to now stand on stage. Both of these events drew crowds as large as the musical artists but have not been put on again.
